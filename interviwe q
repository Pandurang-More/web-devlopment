✅ Choose SQL (Relational Databases) when:

Use MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle if:

Data is highly structured

Schema does not change frequently

You need ACID transactions

You have complex joins & relationships

Data consistency is very critical

📌 Examples:

Banking systems

Payment systems

ERP / HR systems

Inventory management

✅ Choose NoSQL (MongoDB, etc.) when:

Use MongoDB / Redis / Cassandra if:

Data is semi-structured or unstructured

Schema changes frequently

Application needs high scalability

Read/write performance is important

Data can be denormalized

📌 Examples:

Social media apps

E-commerce product catalogs

Real-time analytics

IoT applications
