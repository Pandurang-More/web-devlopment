Introduction to API & Postman – Notes
====================================================

1. Introduction to API

Definition:
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It acts as a bridge that allows two software applications to talk to each other.

Examples given:

• Google Maps  
  Food delivery apps (like UberEats) use the Google Maps API to show locations
  instead of building their own maps.

• Weather Applications  
  Your phone's weather app fetches data from a remote server using an API.

• Payment Gateways  
  Websites use APIs from PayPal or banks to process payments securely.


----------------------------------------------------

2. How API Works (The Waiter Analogy)

The instructor explains the concept using a restaurant diagram:

• The Client (Customer)  
  The person who wants something (e.g., a mobile app or browser).

• The API (Waiter)  
  The messenger. It takes the Request from the client and delivers it to the kitchen.

• The Server (Kitchen)  
  The system that processes the request and prepares the "food" (data).

• The Response  
  The waiter (API) brings the prepared food (data) back to the customer (Client).


----------------------------------------------------

3. Types of APIs

The instructor categorizes APIs into three main types:

• Hardware APIs  
  Allow software to talk to hardware (e.g., using the camera on a phone).

• Operating System (OS) APIs  
  editing the photos,applying filter.

• Web APIs  
  your post on instagram

REST API:
REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most popular
architectural style for Web APIs.


----------------------------------------------------

4. Introduction to Postman

What is it?
Postman is an API Client tool used to design, build, and test APIs.

Why use it?
It provides a user-friendly interface (GUI) to send requests without writing code.


----------------------------------------------------

5. Workspaces and Collections

Workspace:
The personal or team environment where you organize your work.

Collections:
These are like folders on your computer.
They are used to group related API requests together to keep things organized
(e.g., keeping all "Book Store" requests in one folder).


----------------------------------------------------

6. HTTP Methods (Verbs)

The instructor maps HTTP methods to database actions:

• GET  
  Used to retrieve or fetch data from the server.

• POST  
  Used to send data to the server to create a new resource.

• PUT  
  Used to update an existing resource completely.

• PATCH  
  Used to partially update a resource (only specific fields).

• DELETE  
  Used to remove data from the server.


----------------------------------------------------

7. URL Structure

The instructor breaks down the URL:
https://simple-books-api.glitch.me/books

• Protocol  
  https://

• Domain (Base URL)  
  simple-books-api.glitch.me  
  (The address of the server)

• Endpoint (Path)  
  /books  
  (The specific location of the data you want)


----------------------------------------------------

8. Query Parameters

Purpose:
Used to filter or sort the data you are requesting.

Syntax:
Starts with a question mark ? at the end of the URL.

Format:
key=value

Example:
.../books?type=fiction

This tells the server to only return books where the type is "fiction".

Multiple Parameters:
You can add more filters using the ampersand & symbol.
Example:
?type=fiction&limit=5


----------------------------------------------------

9. Path Parameters

Purpose:
Used to point to a specific resource (like a specific book ID).

Syntax:
In Postman, these are often defined with a colon : (e.g., /books/:bookId),
but in the actual URL, you just put the value.

Example:
.../books/1  
(Where 1 is the ID of the specific book you want to see)
GET:https://githum.com/Pandurang-More


----------------------------------------------------

10. Status Codes

The instructor lists the most important status codes to remember:

• 200 OK  
  The request was successful.

• 201 Created  
  Successful creation of data (usually after a POST request).

• 204 No Content  
  Successful request but no data returned (often after DELETE).

  300 redirection

• 400 Bad Request  
  The client sent incorrect data.

• 401 Unauthorized  
  Authentication failed (e.g., missing or wrong API key).

• 404 Not Found  
  The resource or endpoint does not exist.

• 500 Internal Server Error  
  The server crashed or had a problem processing the request.


----------------------------------------------------

11. POST Requests and Authentication

Body:
When sending a POST request (creating data),
you must send data in the Body of the request.
The instructor selects JSON format.

Authentication:
Some APIs require permission.
The instructor shows how to add an "Access Token"
in the Authorization tab using the "Bearer Token" type.


----------------------------------------------------

12. Variables

Purpose:
To avoid copying and pasting the same values
(like the Base URL) repeatedly.

Syntax:
Variables in Postman are enclosed in double curly braces:
{{variable_name}}

Levels:

• Global  
  Available everywhere.

• Collection  
  Available only inside the collection.

• Environment  
  Available when a specific environment is active.


----------------------------------------------------

13. JSON Syntax

• Object  
  Represented by curly braces { }  
  Contains key-value pairs.

• Array  
  Represented by square brackets [ ]  
  Contains a list of objects or values.
