🔁 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1️⃣ Requirement Analysis

What happens
- Understand client/user needs
- Gather functional & non-functional requirements
- Create SRS (Software Requirement Specification)

Example
- Login system
- Performance, security, scalability needs

📌 Output: SRS document


2️⃣ System Design

What happens
- Decide system architecture
- Database design
- UI/UX wireframes
- Technology stack selection

Example
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Django
- DB: PostgreSQL

📌 Output: Design documents (HLD, LLD)


3️⃣ Implementation (Coding)

What happens
- Developers write code based on design
- Follow coding standards
- Version control (Git)

Example
- API development
- UI components creation

📌 Output: Working source code


4️⃣ Testing

What happens
- Find bugs and defects
- Ensure software meets requirements

Types of Testing
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

📌 Output: Bug-free, validated software


5️⃣ Deployment

What happens
- Software released to production
- Configure servers
- CI/CD pipelines

Example
- Deploy on AWS / Azure
- Docker, Jenkins

📌 Output: Live application


6️⃣ Maintenance

What happens
- Bug fixing
- Performance improvements
- Feature updates

Example
- Security patches
- New feature addition

📌 Output: Updated & stable system


Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
