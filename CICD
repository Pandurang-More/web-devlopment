🚀 Complete Notes: CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery)

📌 1. Introduction to CI/CD
• Definition: CI/CD is a core concept of DevOps that automates the process of moving code from development to production.
• The Problem: In large applications (like E-commerce), multiple developers work on the same codebase. Manually merging, testing, and deploying code leads to "Integration Hell," errors, and slow releases.


🏗️ 2. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Steps
Any change (bug fix or new feature) goes through these stages:

1. Develop
   Writing code on a local branch.

2. Commit/Push
   Merging local changes into the main branch (often using Git).

3. Build
   Creating Deployable Artifacts (Build Files).
   • Includes source code + dependencies + libraries.
   • Examples: Binary files, Executable files, or .apk files for Android.

4. Test
   Running various automated tests.

5. Release
   Making the application available to end-users.

6. Deploy
   Making the code available on a specific environment.


🧪 3. Types of Testing in CI/CD

Testing is divided into two phases:

Pre-Deployment Tests:
• Unit Tests – Testing individual components (usually done by developers).
• Integration Tests – Checking if different components work together correctly.
• Regression Tests – Ensuring new changes haven't broken existing functionality.

Post-Deployment (End-to-End / E2E Tests):
• Performed after deploying to Staging or Production.
• Includes Security Tests, Smoke Tests, Alpha/Beta Testing.


🌐 4. Deployment Environments

Organizations typically maintain three main environments:

1. Dev (Development)
   Used only by developers for internal testing.

2. Staging (Pre-Production)
   A replica of production used for final demos, manager/CTO approvals, and E2E testing.

3. Prod (Production)
   The live environment accessed by real end-users.


🔄 5. CI vs. CD (The Two Types of CD)

CI: Continuous Integration
• Automates the Build and Test steps.
• Triggered every time a developer commits code.

CD: Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

Feature: Automation
• Continuous Delivery: Automates up to Staging
• Continuous Deployment: Fully automated up to Production

Feature: Approval
• Continuous Delivery: Manual approval required
• Continuous Deployment: No manual intervention

Feature: Use Case
• Continuous Delivery: Banking, Fintech
• Continuous Deployment: Netflix, Hotstar


⚖️ 6. Why do we need CI/CD? (Manual vs Automated)

Manual Issues:
• Integration Hell – Hard to merge multiple developers’ code.
• Code Freeze – Stopping work to manually test and deploy.
• Error Prone – Humans miss bugs in repetitive tasks.
• Backup Restore – Slow recovery causes downtime.

CI/CD Benefits:
• Speed & Reliability – Small, frequent, tested releases.
• Zero Downtime – Users don’t face crashes during updates.
• Automation – YAML scripts handle repetitive work.


🛠️ 7. Tools and Implementation

• YAML Files
  Workflows are defined using .yaml or .yml files.

• GitHub Actions (2019)
  – Native to GitHub
  – Easy setup
  – Visual feedback (Green = success, Red = failure)

• Jenkins (2011)
  – Open-source job orchestrator
  – Very powerful but harder to maintain

• Other Tools
  CircleCI, Travis CI, GitLab CI CD, Bamboo


🚀 8. Deployment Strategies

1. Blue-Green Deployment
   • Two identical environments (Blue = Old, Green = New)
   • Instant traffic switch
   • Easy rollback

2. Canary Deployment
   • Send 5–10% traffic to new version
   • Gradually increase to 100%

3. Rolling Deployment
   • Update servers one by one
   • Application stays online
